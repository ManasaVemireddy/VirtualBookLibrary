# Virtual Book Library

## Description
A full-stack application that allows users to browse and manage a virtual library of books. Users can add books, view details, and maintain their personal library.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- npm (version x.x.x) or Yarn

### Frontend

#### Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

#### Running the Frontend
- Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

#### Installation
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or

   ```

#### Running the Backend
- Start the server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```
- The backend will be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/books` - Get all books
- `GET /api/books/:id` - Get a book by ID
- `POST /api/books` - Add a new book
- `DELETE /api/my-library/:id` - Remove a book from the library

## Contributing

Project Discrition:

Create a virtual book library using React.js, allowing users to browse books, view detailed
information about each book, and manage their personal library. The assignment is
designed to test your understanding of React, component structure, state management,
routing, and good coding practices.

Functionalities:
Pages:
1. Home Page (Book Listing):
 - Display a list of books with details such as title, author, genre, and rating.
 - The books should be displayed in a grid or list format with a search functionality to
filter books by title, author, or genre.
2. Book Details Page:
 - When a book is clicked from the Home page, navigate to a detailed view page.
 - Display detailed information about the selected book including title, author, genre,
rating, description, and publication year.
 - Provide an option to add the book to the "My Library" collection.
3. My Library Page:
 - A separate page that shows the list of books the user has added to their personal
library.
 - Users should be able to remove books from this collection.
Features to Implement:
 - Routing: Implement navigation between pages using `react-router-dom` or any routing
solution.
 - State Management: Use React's state management (`useState`, `useContext`, or any
preferred state management solution) to handle the list of books, selected books, and
the user's personal library.
 - Reusable Components: Create reusable components such as BookCard, BookList, and
SearchBar.
